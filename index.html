    <h1>Keiran Beaton</h1>
    <h3>Short Biography</h3>
    <p>My name is Keiran Beaton, and I grew up in Redmond, Washington. I attended high school at Redmond High School where I played baseball, basketball and football. From there, I went on to attend the University of Washington, majoring in political science. <br> I love sports, arguing about sports, and foods involving pork, which I strongly believe to be the Cadillac of meats. Other activities I enjoy invlude video games, pickup basketball, and going out with my friends. I am currently a student in Code Fellows 201, where I intend to begin an immaculate coder, which will allow me to puruse this as a career path in the future.</p>
